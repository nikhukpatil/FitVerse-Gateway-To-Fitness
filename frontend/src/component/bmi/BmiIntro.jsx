            <p className='mb-10 text-justify'>
                Body Mass Index (BMI) is a numerical value derived from an individual's weight and height. It's a widely used tool in healthcare and fitness circles to assess whether a person's weight falls within a healthy range relative to their height. BMI serves as an initial screening method to identify potential weight-related health risks and guide further evaluation and intervention.While BMI provides a useful snapshot of weight status, it's important to note that it has limitations. For example, BMI does not distinguish between fat mass and lean body mass, so individuals with high muscle mass may have a higher BMI without being overweight or obese. Additionally, BMI may not accurately reflect health risks for certain populations, such as athletes or older adults.
